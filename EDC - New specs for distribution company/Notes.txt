Definitions
----------
1- Manufacturing length: non finished cable where teh outer semi-conductor is finished and other layers are applied over it.

2- Delivery length: Finished Cable.



Design (IEC 63026:2019)
----------
1- Lead sheath is not mentioned in IEC 63026:2019.
2- Oversheath is not mentioned also. However, outer serving is mentioned. The outer serving should be compatible with cable material that is in physical contact with
	such as metal sheath, armour, oversheath or other material).




Water Blocking (EDC Specs)
----------

1- Swelling powder is added to the conductor.
2- Swelling tapes: 
	a-are added before and after any metallic layer without adding two tapes over each other.
	b-Swelling tapes are added before and after any metallic layer except for the conductor.

Testing
----------

1- Type tests on cable systems are required. These tests are not included in IEC 60502-2.
	"Apart from a type test for a land cable system according to IEC 60502-2 or IEC 60840 which
	includes electrical and non-electrical tests, the submarine cable system type test includes a
	more extensive mechanical type test programme prior to electrical testing."

2- Routine Tests

	a- Partial discharge is carried out on manufacturing lengths in addition to delivery lengths.
